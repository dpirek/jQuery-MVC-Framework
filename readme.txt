ABOUT:
This the purpose of this example is to show how to build JavaScript 
application in the MVC pattern. Views, controllers and models are all 
in separate files. No server is required to run this project.

No page based specific logic is being preloaded. Like in server-based
MVC apps, this app is stateles, with the back button support.

Since this runs as single page app (like gmail), the performance 
compared to classic web page based apps is 100x +. 

This demo is a really in alpha mode, so please feel free to let 
me know of any bugs you find.
